    "Answer 6) Code blocks commonly used in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Function Definition Block:\n",
    "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword, followed by the name of the function and a set of parentheses containing any arguments the function accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Condtional Block:\n",
    "Conditional blocks allow you to execute different code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. They start with the if keyword, followed by a condition in parentheses, and can include one or more elif blocks (short for \"else if\") and an optional else block.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)Loop Block:\n",
    "Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times, or until a condition is met. A for loop is used to iterate over an iterable (such as a list or range of numbers), with each iteration assigning the next value to the variable specified after the for keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "D)Exception Handling Block:\n",
    "Exception handling blocks allow you to handle errors that may occur during program execution. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception, and is followed by one or more except blocks that specify how to handle the exception for specific exception types. "
