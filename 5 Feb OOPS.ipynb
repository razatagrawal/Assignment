    "Answer 2)The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., a class. This hides the implementation details of the class from the outside world and protects the data from unwanted access or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class called the superclass or parent class. The subclass or child class can then add or modify these attributes and behaviors, without affecting the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. This allows different objects to respond to the same message or method in different ways, depending on their individual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the practice of focusing on essential features of an object or system, while ignoring the non-essential or irrelevant details. This allows for a simplified representation of the object or system, which can be easier to understand and work with. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces."

    "Answer 3) In Python, the __init__() function is a special method that is called automatically when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object with some default values or values provided by the user. The __init__() method is typically used to set up the object's initial state, allocate resources if necessary, and perform any other necessary setup operations."
